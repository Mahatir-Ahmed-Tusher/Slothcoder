  <strong>AI-powered, affordable, and beginner-friendly coding platform</strong>
</p>

## 🚀 Overview

Sloth Coder is an AI-powered, affordable, and beginner-friendly coding platform that offers everything you need to build full-stack web applications and mobile apps—from idea to deployment—without the usual high costs or technical barriers.

Globally, fewer than 1% of people can code proficiently. In countries like Bangladesh and India, this number is even smaller. Unfortunately, most modern AI-powered coding platforms are expensive, lack localized accessibility, or are not designed to meet the needs of budget-conscious learners and startups. Sloth Coder aims to solve this problem by providing an accessible platform for everyone.

## ✨ Features

Choose from basic to advanced LLMs depending on your plan, including Gemini API, Mistral API, Together API, Anthropic API (Claude series), OpenAI GPT-5 API, and more.

### 🖼️ Image-to-Code Generation
